This is a very simple program written in java for my csc 227 course
 this program reads the txt files in the src folder and then organize it to whatever service the user picks.
 **Cpu.java** is made by **@b1ader**

## services:

### 1-Priority Scheduling.

### 2- shortest remaining time first(SRTF) Scheduling.

### 3- Round Robin(RR) Scheduling.

Basically its a cpu scheduler that schedules the processes in the txt file.

## Todo(Functions):

- [x] SRTF structure rewrite.
- [ ] Manual inputed user.
- [x] IOwriter structure.
